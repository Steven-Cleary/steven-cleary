    <div class="body-1 my-4">
      I enjoy personal finance. Specifically I like to create different
      scenarios and see how things play out. For example how much money would I
      have if I invested $500 a month for 30 years.
    </div>
    <div class="body-1 my-4">
      And I would often use JavaScript to play out these different scenarios.
      Overtime I started building out interfaces and data visualizations as
      well.
    </div>
    <div class="body-1 my-4">
      Now at this time I was working two other projects. But I decided that
      these projects were overly ambitious. And I was looking to create a new
      project that wasn't overly ambitious. Something that I could get done, and
      that people would use.
    </div>
    <div class="body-1 my-4">
      So I decided that I want to create a site where I can post calculators and
      content related to personal finance. But if you are reading this you are
      probably more concerned with the tech that this site was built with.

      <div class="text-h5 font-weight-light my-4">Custom Component Library</div>
      <div class="body-1 my-4">
        We built ourselves a rich set of custom components. This makes writing
        our calculators easy.

      <div class="text-h5 font-weight-light my-4">Easy Deployments</div>
      <div class="body-1 my-4">
        If I want to deploy, I just run a couple of commands and my code is
        deployed.

      <div class="text-h5 font-weight-light my-4">SEO</div>
      <div class="body-1 my-4">
        We built our site with NuxtJS, which gives us the ability to SSR(Server
        Side Render) or CSR(Client Side Render) content. This allows us to
        create content that search engines can read but also client side render
        more complex content to improve page load speed and user experience.

      <v-divider class="my-10" />
      <div class="text-h5 font-weight-light my-4">Material UI</div>
      <div class="body-1 my-4">
        We use VuetifyJS.
        <span class="font-italic"
          >"Vuetify is a Vue UI Library with beautifully handcrafted Material
          Components"</span
        >
        - Vuetify Landing Page. This allows us to create great user experiences
        without having to recreate many of the basic web components used across
        the web.
