# Hello

My name is Steven Cleary.

On here you will be able to find the [source code for my portfolio project](https://github.com/Steven-Cleary/steven-cleary).

I spend most of my time working on my side project [financiallyfinanced.com](https://financiallyfinanced.com). However the source code for this project is in a private repo so you wont be able to see it unless you reach out to me.

If you would like to see a showcase of all my projects please visit [stevencleary.com](https://stevencleary.com).

The best way to reach me is by email.
